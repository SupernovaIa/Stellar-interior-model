# Stellar Interior Simulation Project

## 📜 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a numerical model to simulate the interior of a massive star in the main sequence. Specifically, we study the structure of a star characterized by a convective core and a radiative envelope. Starting with known values of mass and chemical composition, the model integrates the fundamental equations governing plasma behavior to analyze the stellar interior.

The process involves integrating from the star's surface inward and from the core outward, adjusting the boundary between the convective core and radiative envelope to ensure a smooth transition. To achieve this, central temperature, total luminosity, and total radius (initially unknown) are iteratively refined.

## 🧠 Conclusions

Throughout this work, a numerical model of a stellar interior was developed, providing valuable insights into the structure of a star with mass M > 2M☉. The project involved implementing numerical integration of the differential equations governing its behavior.

In particular, the project allowed for a deeper understanding of the mixed integration approach, combining integration from the surface inward and from the core outward, with matching solutions in the transition layer between radiative and convective zones.

We conclude that this simplified model, despite significant assumptions, offers valuable information about stellar structure, energy generation within the star, and even observable parameters such as total luminosity, total radius, and effective temperature. These results made it possible to classify the star's spectral type and position it on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram alongside similar known stars.


## 🔄 Next Steps

The project lays the groundwork for possible future enhancements to the model, such as:

- Incorporating temporal evolution of the star as hydrogen is consumed.
- Studying chemical composition as a function of distance from the center.
- Considering additional sources of opacity.
- Extending support to model low-mass stars.
